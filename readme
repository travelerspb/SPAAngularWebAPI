REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you donâ€™t know how to create your own backend you can use Parse.com, Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.
All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable.
Bonus: unit tests!
You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.
